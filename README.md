# JavaKara Code Generator

This is a small python tool in development to simplify the creation of walking paths for the ladybug "Kara".

## Features (planned and already included)
- Select boxes
- Toggle through 4 different states, depending on if Kara should just walk over it or pu/removet a leaf too
- Select tool to directly set boxes to a certain state
- define custom function names for the default functions: `kara.move()`, `kara.turnLight()`, `kara.turnLeft()`, `kara.putLeaf()`,`kara.removeLeaf()`
- Copy Java code to clipboard
